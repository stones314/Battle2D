/*! \page autounits Automatic Unit Generation

## Manualy designed units
Normally in an autobattler the units that you buy in the shop phase are designed manually by the game designers. However it takes a lot of work to design fun and balanced units. 

## Automatically generated Units
In ASAB I want to try out automatically generated units.

In this case the designer only has to design the main mechanics and some visual stuff representing that mechanic. Units can be generated by adding random stats and mechanics.

## Balance?
The game will need some way to calculate the strength of a unit. The best way is probably to have a set of benchmarks that generated units can be tested against.

For example: If the unit is a card like in HS Battlegrounds, we can simulate a series of battles with the generated card against fixed opposing boards that get progressivly stronger. The metric of the benchmark can be the average number of rounds it "survives".

## Flavor?
How can this randomness be part of the games flavor?

Some ideas:
- evolution
- quantum randomnes
- mutations caused by radiation
- sport team player stats
