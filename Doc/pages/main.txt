## Idea
This game is an asynchronous <b>autobattler</b>. An autobattler is typically a game played over several \ref Round "Rounds", where each round consists of at least these two \ref Phase "Phases":

1. Shop - buy/upgrade your <b>army</b>, and position the <b>units</b> in the army

2. Battle - automatic based on rules and random chance

Normally you play live against other players, performing the rounds synchronously.

The synchronous nature leads to some required features:
1. The game requires a timer, players must perform their moves within a given time.
2. The game requires that you are available for its duration.

Some players dislike these features (including me). That is why I want to make an asynchronous autobattler!

## How?

After the shop phase your army is saved on a server, and then you load an opponent from that server based on how many rounds you have played. Round 1 you play against a stored round-1 opponent, round 2 agains a round-2 opponent and so on.
